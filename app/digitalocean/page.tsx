                      DigitalOcean has a transparent and predictable pricing
                      model that charges only for what you use. You can choose
                      from different droplet sizes and other services with fixed
                      monthly or hourly rates. Other cloud hosting providers may

                      many factors such as instance types, regions, usage, data
                      transfer, and additional features.
